Coursework for CS 307 (Modeling and Learning in Data Science) at UIUC. I am taking this class during the Spring 2025 semester (presently).

## Course Description
Introduction to the use of classical approaches in data modeling and machine learning in the context of solving data-centric problems. A broad coverage of fundamental models is presented, including linear models, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and deep learning. A significant emphasis is placed on the application of the models in Python and the interpretability of the results.
